# WGP-LinuxConfig
Configuration preferences for Linux so I don't have to copy configurations everytime

Includes config files for bash and vim. More added as I configure more

# Install
This will append my configuration to whatever is already there so as to not delete precious previous configurations

    git clone https://github.com/wgpierce/WGP-LinuxConfig.git
    cd WGP-LinuxConfig
    ./install.sh
